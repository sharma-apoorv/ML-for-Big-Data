# Machine Learning for Big Data

This repo contains some of the popular algorithms often used in Machine Learning when analyzing big data. There are a total of 9 algorithms/projects that were completed:

1. Friendship Recommendation
   1. This was used to practice Spark and get familiar with using PySpark.
2. A-priori algorithm
   1. Here the A-priori algorithm was implemented to find products which are frequently browsed together.
3. Alternating Least Square (ALS)
   1. In many real-world applications, it’s expensive to collect explicit rating data. However, it’s cheap to collect implicit feedback data such as clicks, page views, purchases and media streams at a large and fast scale. In this, the ALS algorithm was implemented to recommend music artists based on implicit data. 
4. K-means
   1. The k-means algorithm aims to partition a dataset into k clusters, to minimize the distance metric between each point, within the cluster. Here the k-means algorithm was implemented for 2 different distance metrics and 2 different initialization criteria.
5. PCA
   1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction algorithm that represents the data matrix as a set of principal components that are orthogonal to each other. Here PCA was implemented to reconstruct pictures of faces in the PCA basis.
6. SVM
   1. Here the soft-margin SVM using different methods of gradient descent. The different methods of gradient descent include: 
      1. Batch Gradient Descent (BGD)
      2. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
      3. Mini-Batch Gradient Descent (MBGD)
